# eddy_fp
a deterministic, training‑free framework that transforms 3‑D ocean eddies into a canonical, rotation‑ and scale‑invariant coordinate system.

Compared with existing mesoscale eddy detection approaches—including classical SSH‑based methods, hybrid SSH–velocity systems, and recent 3‑D deep learning architectures such as 3D‑U‑Res‑Net and 3D‑EddyNet—F2 offers a fundamentally different capability.
Whereas current methods focus on classification, segmentation, or contour extraction, F2 provides a deterministic, training‑free framework that transforms every 3‑D eddy into a canonical, rotation‑ and scale‑invariant coordinate system. This enables direct, interpretable cross‑eddy comparisons using morphometric and topological metrics—capabilities absent from all reviewed literature. Deep learning methods can reproduce known eddies but rely heavily on training labels and do not offer canonical shape normalization; hybrid geometric methods extract 3‑D volumes but remain non‑comparable; SSH‑based detectors retain radius biases and miss essential vertical structure. In contrast, F2 produces a stable, physics‑aware fingerprint fully compatible with next‑generation high‑resolution datasets such as SWOT, enabling unified analysis across regions, datasets, and model resolutions.
